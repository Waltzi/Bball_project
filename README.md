Software Eng spring semester 2024

Authors: Austin Leibensperger, Saul Sanchez, Nathan Hajel, and Brandon Yang

The TermTeamProject repo holds everything for the backend properties of the project.
- The FetchCreateTeamDatabase.java class creates the given MoravianWomenBasketball database locally within your computer using mysql. This uses the JDBC Driver to connect to mysql with the required Url, username, and password
- In order to run the program properly in vscode add the mysql-connector file to your referenced libraries of the java project.

- Sprint 1 Goal:
  Create a simple GUI that takes user input to add and delete players from the roster, freethrow, and threepoint tables in the MoravianWomenBasketball database. Also create web app prerequisites we have within the group for the next sprint. 

- Sprint 2 Goal:
  Complete our SpringBoot Web App and get it running correctly. Implement an archiving method for the roster and allow practices to be separrated by dates.
